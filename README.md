## Myhome

This repository contains all miscelaneous stuff that I use in my home
directory.

The 'link.sh' script creates the necessary symlinks.

There are no secrets here.
The secrets are stored in a Dropbox folder ~/Dropbox/personal/myhome
I know Dropbox isn't the most secure option, but it's etter than putting stuff in
a public github repository and pray that it will remain unnoticed ;)
